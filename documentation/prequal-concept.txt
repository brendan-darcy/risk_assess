## Backkground

We want to be able to generate sample data to demostrate prequalify features for our product. It has two parts:
- data Collection
- classification and scoring


Pre-Qualify – Data Collection
At the time of instruction, ARMATech automatically gathers and links property data and imagery to the backend database using the property address. This process references external APIs and locally hosted data from the Apprise Master Address File (MAF) to build a comprehensive property record.
The data is processed and categorised into structured fields, so it can be used in downstream processes. Data collected includes:
•	Instructions: Client identity, property address, estimate, job type,  parties, and comments.
•	Location and Administrative: Local government authority, geographic coordinates, and surrounding area context.
•	Mapping and Topography: Geocoding, boundary geometry, elevation, slope, property type, and proximity to value drivers or blights.
•	Legal: Property’s formal identity including title information and land authority references.
•	Characteristics: Property type, form, key attributes such as room counts (bed, bath, living), car spaces, building dimensions, layout, construction era, and notable features.
•	Occupancy: How the property is being used, zoning, planning, and development applications.
•	Local Market: Sales and rental data, including time series for median prices, sales value and distribution, discounting, yields, and matched pairs of sales within a development.
•	Transaction History: Sales history of the subject property.
•	Campaigns: Historical and current marketing campaigns with timelines and advertising extracts.
•	Sales Evidence: Comparable sales in the property’s precinct.


Pre-Qualify – Classification and Scoring
Apprise’s data science team has developed a range of predictive scores and Computer Vision models. These proprietary models and algorithms are all hosted locally in our own secure environments and are applied to the subject property to be valued, and the possible sales evidence, all at the time of instruction.
Imagery Tagging and Scores

•	Layer 1 Tagging – Identifies high level classifications such as: Indoor, Outdoor, Aerial, Floorplan, Under Construction, Not a property image
•	Layer 2 Tagging – Bathroom, Entrance, Garage / Shed, Kitchen, Laundry, Living space, Pool, Recreational room, Sauna, Wine cellar, Carport, Frontage, Garage/Shed, Garden, Living space, Local or scenery image, Pool, Tennis court.
•	Layer 3 Quality Scores – Quality of build for kitchen, wet rooms and street appeal.
•	Completeness - indicating timeliness, quality and depth of imagery available.
•	Strata Plans – derived characteristics from the strata plan or floorplan.

Image xx – Example of Pre-Qualify Layer 3 Processing for Kitchens 

The above image is an example of Computer Vision’s Layer 3 processing.
o	Step 1 - Once Layer 2 processing is complete, we pass all images classified as ‘Kitchen’ into Layer 3.
o	Step 2 - Computer Vision then assesses each image across a range of dimensions: cabinetry, appliances, tapware, benchtops, overall style coherence etc
o	Step 3 – An overall Kitchen Grade is produced for each image

Market Scores
A series of algorithms that assess and summarise trends and liquidity of the local market and the property uniqueness:
•	Trends: Indicates price movement—rising, falling, flat, or volatile.
•	Local Liquidity: Measures market activity using sales density, discounting, and trends.
•	Secondary Market Liquidity: Evaluates liquidity using matched pairs of sales (same property sales) for high-density or new developments. An overall score of the liquidity is provided.
•	Uniqueness: Scores how distinct the subject property is compared to its local market.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
ARMATech applies NLP techniques to analyse descriptions of the subject property, same development sales, and local planning documents. This enables the system to flag bespoke or out-of-scope land uses, including:
•	Acreages: Properties over 5,000 sqm where residential use is permitted under the zoning.
•	Display Homes: Properties previously used as display homes by developers.
•	Holiday Rentals: Developments wholly or partially designated for holiday rental use.
•	Serviced Apartments: Developments with serviced apartment usage.
•	Dual Occupancy: Properties detected as likely having a second dwelling on title.
•	Business Use: a business is operated at the property makes it difficult to sell as vacant possession.
