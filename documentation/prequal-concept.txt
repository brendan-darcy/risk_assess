## Backkground

We want to be able to generate sample data to demostrate prequalify features for our product. It has two parts:
- data Collection
- classification and scoring


Pre-Qualify – Data Collection
At the time of instruction, ARMATech automatically gathers and links property data and imagery to the backend database using the property address. This process references external APIs and locally hosted data from the Apprise Master Address File (MAF) to build a comprehensive property record.
The data is processed and categorised into structured fields, so it can be used in downstream processes. Data collected includes:
•	Instructions: Client identity, property address, estimate, job type,  parties, and comments.
•	Location and Administrative: Local government authority, geographic coordinates, and surrounding area context.
•	Mapping and Topography: Geocoding, boundary geometry, elevation, slope, property type, and proximity to value drivers or blights.
•	Legal: Property’s formal identity including title information and land authority references.
•	Characteristics: Property type, form, key attributes such as room counts (bed, bath, living), car spaces, building dimensions, layout, construction era, and notable features.
•	Occupancy: How the property is being used, zoning, planning, and development applications.
•	Local Market: Sales and rental data, including time series for median prices, sales value and distribution, discounting, yields, and matched pairs of sales within a development.
•	Transaction History: Sales history of the subject property.
•	Campaigns: Historical and current marketing campaigns with timelines and advertising extracts.
•	Sales Evidence: Comparable sales in the property’s precinct.


Pre-Qualify – Classification and Scoring
Apprise’s data science team has developed a range of predictive scores and Computer Vision models. These proprietary models and algorithms are all hosted locally in our own secure environments and are applied to the subject property to be valued, and the possible sales evidence, all at the time of instruction.
Imagery Tagging and Scores

•	Layer 1 Tagging – Identifies high level classifications such as: Indoor, Outdoor, Aerial, Floorplan, Under Construction, Not a property image
•	Layer 2 Tagging – Bathroom, Entrance, Garage / Shed, Kitchen, Laundry, Living space, Pool, Recreational room, Sauna, Wine cellar, Carport, Frontage, Garage/Shed, Garden, Living space, Local or scenery image, Pool, Tennis court.
•	Layer 3 Quality Scores – Quality of build for kitchen, wet rooms and street appeal.
•	Completeness - indicating timeliness, quality and depth of imagery available.
•	Strata Plans – derived characteristics from the strata plan or floorplan.

The above image is an example of Computer Vision’s Layer 3 processing.
o	Step 1 - Once Layer 2 processing is complete, we pass all images classified as ‘Kitchen’ into Layer 3.
o	Step 2 - Computer Vision then assesses each image across a range of dimensions: cabinetry, appliances, tapware, benchtops, overall style coherence etc
o	Step 3 – An overall Kitchen Grade is produced for each image

Market Scores
A series of algorithms that assess and summarise trends and liquidity of the local market and the property uniqueness:
•	Trends: Indicates price movement—rising, falling, flat, or volatile.
•	Local Liquidity: Measures market activity using sales density, discounting, and trends.
•	Secondary Market Liquidity: Evaluates liquidity using matched pairs of sales (same property sales) for high-density or new developments. An overall score of the liquidity is provided.
•	Uniqueness: Scores how distinct the subject property is compared to its local market.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
ARMATech applies NLP techniques to analyse descriptions of the subject property, same development sales, and local planning documents. This enables the system to flag bespoke or out-of-scope land uses, including:
•	Acreages: Properties over 5,000 sqm where residential use is permitted under the zoning.
•	Display Homes: Properties previously used as display homes by developers.
•	Holiday Rentals: Developments wholly or partially designated for holiday rental use.
•	Serviced Apartments: Developments with serviced apartment usage.
•	Dual Occupancy: Properties detected as likely having a second dwelling on title.
•	Business Use: a business is operated at the property makes it difficult to sell as vacant possession.




Appendix

Tech Breakout – ARMATech Computer Vision Capability

Overview

Smart Gallery is powered by ARMATech’s proprietary Computer Vision Model - the only model of its kind to be trained specifically for valuations in Australia.

Images are classified into fine-grained categories to identify the most valuable images. This assists the valuer in identifying the most relevant information for comparability. The result is a more robust selection of sales and a more accurate outcome.

Model Layers

Apprise Computer Vision follows a layered approach, two for classifying images and one for grading.





Layer 1

“High Level Classifications”	Layer 2

“Granular Classifications”	Layer 3

“Grading”
Top level classification to identify broad grouping, and to select the correct Layer 2 Model (indoor or outdoor).	Detailed classification to identify precise grouping, and to identify the value driver images for Layer 3 grading.	Grading of important value-driver images. Each image is given an overall grade from 1 to 5, to enable valuers to filter more accurately and efficiently.
Categories
Indoor, Outdoor, Aerial, Floorplan, Under construction, Not a property image
De-deduplication

	Categories
Indoor Model: Bathroom, Entrance, Garage/Shed, Kitchen, Laundry, Living space, Pool, Recreational room, Sauna, Wine cellar, Carport
Outdoor Model: Frontage, Garage/Shed, Garden, Living space, Local or scenery image, Pool, Tennis court	Images for grading

•	Kitchen
•	Wet rooms – laundry & bathrooms
•	Frontage

In a typical job, ARMATech’s distributed computing architecture orchestrates model processing for over 5000 images in under two minutes, which the valuer can access in a locally on the browser in a low latency user experience.
 
Classification – a major upgrade to standard desktops

Classification is a powerful computer vision capability in ARMATech. The process turns unstructured data into structured data that can be more accurately and efficiently assessed. Traditional desktop tooling shows imagery in an unstructured order, and with many duplicates. This creates the risk that imagery that is tagged as recent is actually old, and also increases the chances of selecting imagery that does not reflect the current state of the property.

Figure xx – Example of how classification improves filtering
 
[Savannah – can we make this look better plese.]

The above image demonstrates how ARMATech’s Computer Vision transforms desktop valuation workflows. In this example for the subject property, Apprise’s ARMATech Smart Gallery classifies 72 images from three campaigns, and produces cleaned, deduplicated, and tagged imagery.

In Summary

ARMATech’s Computer Vision capability is a powerful AI model trained specifically for valuations and unique in the industry. Computer Vision is powerful because it enables valuers to efficiently identify and review the most relevant images that drive value and avoid erroneous conclusions that are common in standard desktop tooling.
